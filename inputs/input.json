      "body":"This PR introduces the following  changes:\r\n\r\n## New features\r\n\r\n### Metadata in `PeerStatus`\r\nEach entry (`PeerStatus`) in the Heartbeat peer registry (`Network`) now contains a dictionary of per-peer metadata. This an arbitrary dictionary of string-based key-value pairs. It starts as empty (or can be pre-populated by using `add_with_metadata` method when new peer entry is added), but can be updated on each `update_with_metadata` call - the changes are merged (upserted).\r\n\r\n### Added `protocol_version` metadata\r\nThe ping mechanism is enhanced to extract the current HOPR protocol version from the ping sub-protocol transport layer. This extracted value is then used as metadata for the respective `PeerStatus` entry in the Heartbeat registry. This effectively adds the reported protocol version information into the peer registry, from where it could be later queried.\r\n\r\n### The `reportedVersion` exposed in the `v2/node/ping` and `v2/node/peers` API endpoints\r\nA new entry `reportedVersion` entry is added to the HTTP response body of the Ping API endpoint. The value contains the latest protocol version queried from the heartbeat peer registry (where it's been updated after the ping).\r\n\r\n## Refactoring\r\n\r\n### Automatic serialization method\r\nA new trait `AutoBinarySerializable` has been introduced. The trait poses as a default implementation of the `BinarySerializable` trait that has been introduced earlier. The default implementation uses `bincode` binary format to perform automatic serialization/deserialization of the type that implements `AutoBinarySerializable`, instead of having to implement that manually if only `BinarySerializable` trait has been implemented.\r\n\r\nWhen a developer is about to introduce a new type `X` that needs serialization, they can decide whether to use either:\r\n- an effortless serialization strategy: `impl AutoBinarySerializable for X { }` \r\n- or write their own serialization format: `impl BinarySerializable for X { ... }`\r\n\r\nThe `AutoBinarySerializable` trait is meant to abstract out the underlying binary format, so e.g. `bincode` can be replaced in the future with a different one if needed (`minicbor`, `protobuf`...).\r\n\r\n### Ping sub-protocol enhancements\r\nThe ping/pong protocol messages are now implemented as types using the `ControlMessage` sub-protocol. This already uses the newly introduced `AutoBinarySerializable` strategy and relevant cryptographic code from the `core-crypto` crate. Due to backwards compatibility, a new `compat-ping` feature has been introduced to `core-network` crate (enabled by default), so that the ping/pong messages are compatible with older HOPR versions when serialized/deserialized. The `compat-ping` feature will be turned off in the future backwards incompatible release. This opens up the possibility of extending the `ControlMessage` sub-protocol in the future, so it can carry more data (e.g. to report locally perceived peer qualities in order to allow https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/issues/4720).\r\n\r\nCloses https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/issues/4547",

      "body":"This PR brings the following fixes to `core-strategy`, namely to the Promiscuous strategy:\r\n\r\n- a new internal setting allows the strategy to close channels (even if with high-quality peer) if the maximum number of channels (either manual or computed automatically from the network size) has been exceeded. This setting is enabled by default, so the strategy will be aggressive in enforcing the maximum number of opened channels. No distinction is done between channels opened manually or via the strategy.\r\n- an integer overflow possibility has been fixed, which sometimes caused a more than the allowed number of channels to be opened (fixes https://github.com/hoprnet/hoprnet/issues/4776)\r\n\r\nAlso all the strategies were refactored to use `libp2p_identity::PeerId` rather than strings and the WASM binding code has been simplified.",

      "body":"## What\r\nThe overall configurability of the HOPRd has been severely extended by the ability to ingest configuration from a YAML configuration file. The configuration layering of the daemon is now 3 fold, with the order of configuration as follows:\r\n- YAML configuration is used as a default and if provided, it must contain the full configuration set for the daemon\r\n- command line arguments allow overriding specific sections of the base configuration\r\n- environment variables add overrides along the command line arguments\r\n\r\nIt is wise an recommended to stick to a single type of configuration, but it is fully possible to create a setup in which a YAML configuration file is loaded, some of its values are overridden by the command line arguments and furthermore some configuration options are taken from an env variable.\r\n\r\n## Design features\r\n* `CliArgs` are a separate entity from the `HoprdConfig` -\u003e it is possible to include only parts of the configuration as CLI arguments/env var arguments\r\n* `HoprdConfig` uses serde serialization and deserialization\r\n* `HoprdConfig` uses `validator` based validation mechanism (on top of the parsing mechanism from the CliArgs)\r\n* The YAML configuration is optional, if no configuration file is supplied, a reasonable default is generated automatically\r\n  * The default represents an invalid configuration - e.g. password and private_key are not generated\r\n* cli arguments are mapped into the configuration using a custom transformation function\r\n* configuration errors are derived from the `thiserror` package\r\n\r\n## Example\r\nPreliminary layout of the configuration file:\r\n```yaml\r\nhost:\r\n  ip: 127.0.0.1\r\n  port: 47462\r\nidentity:\r\n  file: identity\r\n  password: ''\r\n  private_key: ''\r\ndb:\r\n  data: /tmp/db\r\n  init: false\r\n  force_init: false\r\napi:\r\n  enabled: false\r\n  auth: None\r\n  host:\r\n    ip: 127.0.0.1\r\n    port: 1233\r\nstrategy:\r\n  name: null\r\n  max_auto_channels: null\r\n  auto_redeem_tickets: false\r\nheartbeat:\r\n  interval: 0\r\n  threshold: 0\r\n  variance: 0\r\nnetwork:\r\n  announce: false\r\n  allow_local_node_connections: false\r\n  allow_private_node_connections: false\r\n  max_parallel_connections: 0\r\n  network_quality_threshold: 0.0\r\nhealthcheck:\r\n  enabled: false\r\n  host: 127.0.0.1\r\n  port: 0\r\nenvironment: testing\r\nchain:\r\n  provider: null\r\n  check_unrealized_balance: false\r\n  on_chain_confirmations: 0\r\ntest:\r\n  announce_local_addresses: false\r\n  prefer_local_addresses: false\r\n  use_weak_crypto: false\r\n  no_direct_connections: false\r\n  no_webrtc_upgrade: false\r\n  local_mode_stun: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nCloses #4742\r\nCloses #4611",
